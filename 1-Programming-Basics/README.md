## Introduction

The course "Programming Basics" provides foundational programming skills necessary for all technology-related professions at Software University (SoftUni).

## What is covered?

This module includes writing introductory-level code, working with integrated development environments (IDEs), using variables and data, handling operators and expressions, interacting with the console (reading input and printing results), and employing conditional constructs (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).

## Skills I have acquired:

- Console input and output operations
- Working with loops (for)
- Handling more complex logical checks
- Working with conditional statements (if-else)
- Performing basic computations
- Working with more advanced loops (nested for-loops and while loops)

## Module Structure

Every covered topic is divided into two separate lectures - lab and exercise parts.

The lab lecture is designed for covering the material and solving simple problems, while the exercise lecture is dedicated to solving more challenging problems.

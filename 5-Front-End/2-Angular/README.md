## Introduction

The "Frontend Framework - Angular" submodule provides knowledge and practical skills for building Single Page Applications (SPAs) using the Angular framework. Participants will learn about TypeScript, its basic syntax, and concepts, exploring its advantages over JavaScript. The course covers the development conveniences offered by TypeScript for both browser and mobile platforms.

Participants will delve into Single Page Application (SPA) concepts, architectural patterns for SPA applications, components, directives, and their implementation in Angular. The submodule also covers views and data visualization templates, models, components, data binding, working with multiple views, observables, routing, data extraction from REST services, and dependency injection (DI).

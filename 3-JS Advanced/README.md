## Introduction

The "JS Advanced" module offers an in-depth exploration of JavaScript functionality, focusing on its most common usage environmentâ€”the browser. This module covers JavaScript as a core syntax, allowing participants to grasp programming concepts through the language's lens. It delves into functional programming and explores the differences with object-oriented programming.

Participants will study browser elements in detail, including the DOM tree, learning how to add, remove, and edit elements within it. The module also covers unit testing and fundamental testing approaches. By the end of the module, participants will possess the knowledge to create Single Page Applications (SPA) entirely written in JavaScript, incorporating concepts such as Routing and Templating. Additionally, they will learn to use databases as a service.

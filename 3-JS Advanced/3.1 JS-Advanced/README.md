## About the Course

In the "JS Advanced" course, participants will deepen their knowledge of the JavaScript language, covering syntax fundamentals, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes, and writing functions. The course explores advanced concepts such as function context, explicit binding, and the event loop. It enhances participants' algorithmic thinking and, upon successful completion, enables them to manipulate the DOM tree, handle events, and work with "event"-s.

The course covers both the functional and object-oriented programming approaches in JavaScript, delving into concepts like inheritance, object composition, and the prototype chain.

#Softuni JavaScript Back-end course

## Course introduction:
The course aims to introduce participants 
to the development of server-side JavaScript applications 
on the Node.js platform using Express.js as a framework.

During the training, it will be explained how to create a 
server with Node.js, the server-client architecture and
how to make easy and fast data-driven web applications
with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB using competing

## Introduction

The "Programming Fundamentals" module is an integral part of the internal curriculum at SoftUni, providing a comprehensive foundation for aspiring software engineers. This course delves into fundamental programming concepts, building upon the knowledge gained in the "Programming Basics" course. Participants advance their skills and begin employing more sophisticated programming techniques and structures, including dictionaries, objects, and classes.

## Skills I have acquired 

- Working with the standard functionality of programming languages
- Handling linear data structures
- Understanding the interconnection between various IT concepts
- Analyzing problems and reducing them to computer-executable steps
- Basic skills in working with HTML and CSS

## Module Structure

This module includes two types of topics: traditional topics, divided into two lectures (introduction and exercise), and "common lectures," which are informative sessions designed to broaden your programming perspective.

There are two exams: the "Mid Exam," which must be passed to continue with the course, and the "Final Exam," required to progress to the next module in the "JavaScript Web Developer" curriculum.
